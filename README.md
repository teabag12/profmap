# Open TODOS
- I've used 'TODO' markers for identifying snippets in the code that still need some work as well as open questions
- there's 3 big questions:
    1. how can the map be integrated into the main project?
    2. right now, the map uses sample data that is initialized within the JS -> how can the actual profiteers list be accessed, how can the coordinates of the location of the offices be accessed?
    3. since the basemap is not open source, where can the API key be stored securely?
