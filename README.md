# Open TODOS
- I've used 'TODO' markers for identifying snippets in the code that still need some work as well as open questions
- there's 3 big questions:
    1. how can the map be integrated into the main project?
    2. right now, the map uses sample data that is initialized within the JS -> how can the actual profiteers list be accessed? how can the coordinates of the location of the offices be accessed?
    3. since using the whole functionality of the basemap requires an API key, where can the that key be stored securely? how can it be renewed after its current validity period?
