# Open TODOS
- I've used 'TODO' markers for identifying snippets in the code that still need some work as well as open questions
- there's 3 big questions:
-- how can the map be integrated into the main project?
-- right now, the map uses sample data that is initialized within the JS -> how can the actual profiteers list be accessed, how can the coordinates of the location of the offices be accessed?
-- since the basemap is not open source, where can the API key be stored securely?
